# PWM_LED_Contoller
College project using PIC18F4520 microcontroller for PWM dimming.

This project utilises the PICs two hardware PWM modules to dim LED lights.
Pin RD4 is configured as a digital input to allow connection to a motion sensor.
Pin RA0 is configure as an analog input to allow connection to a photocell.
The PIC can communicate with an mobile phone over Bluetooth and using the EUSART module.
Light levels can be saved and recalled to and from the PIC's EEPROM.
